# Mode Integration

We deployed our Google Drive-like wallet management system, utilizing ERC6551 token-bound accounts and ERC4337 account abstraction, to Mode Testnet. We believe this innovative approach to wallet management can transform the user experience in DeFi interactions.

Additionally, we integrated WalletConnect and demonstrated its functionality with Uniswap.
