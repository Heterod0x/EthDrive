# Base Integration

EthDrive is a service that allows users to manage assets and make payments with a user experience similar to Google Drive, which many people are already familiar with. Even beginners can easily move and manage assets through drag-and-drop functionality. Additionally, users can organize their assets by categorizing directories based on the types and purposes of tokens, such as DeFi or NFTs, which helps minimize the risk of theft. By utilizing the EthDrive chain (L2), gasless transactions are also possible, making EthDrive the most user-friendly service for crypto beginners to start with.
