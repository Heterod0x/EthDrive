## Description

EthDrive is a service that allows you to organize and manage the assets in your wallet like Google Drive. By combining ERC6551 and Account Abstraction, it enables asset organization, transfers, bridging, swapping, and even connections to various dApps with a user-friendly interface similar to cloud storage services.

Directories are created as NFTs, and assets can be stored within them. This allows users to view all directories transparently and centrally, much like directory functions within a single computer. We call this the Universal Directory. Just like ENS, all directories become part of the Universal Directory, making it accessible for everyone to use.

To enhance the UX of EthDrive, we have created a dedicated L2 chain for gas fee subsidies. Users with a World ID can receive gas fee subsidies, making EthDrive even more convenient to use.
